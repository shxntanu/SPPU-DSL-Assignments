Codes of the Assignments in the DSL Lab Manual of SPPU Second Year Computer Engineering Syllabus.

Problem Statements: 

### Question 1:

In second year computer engineering class, group A studentâ€™s play cricket, group B students
play badminton and group C students play football. Write a Python program using functions
to compute following: - 

1. List of students who play both cricket and badminton 
2. List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both 
3. Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton 
4. Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton. 

(Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET built-in functions)

### Question 2:

Write a Python program to compute following operations on String:

1. To display word with the longest length 
2. To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string 
3. To check whether given string is palindrome or not 
4. To display index of first appearance of the substring 
5. To count the occurrences of each word in a given string 

(Do not use string built-in functions)

### Question 3: 

Write a python program to compute following computation on matrix:

1. Addition of two matrices 
2. Subtraction of two matrices
3. Multiplication of two matrices 
4. Transpose of a matrix

### Question 4: 

1. Write a python program to store roll numbers of student in array who attended training
program in random order. Write function for searching whether particular student attended
training program or not, using Linear search and Sentinel search.

2.  Write a python program to store roll numbers of student array who attended training
program in sorted order. Write function for searching whether particular student attended
training program or not, using Binary search and Fibonacci search
